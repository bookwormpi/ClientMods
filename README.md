# ClientSideTesting

[![Build Status](https://github.com/bookwormpi/ClientSideTesting/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/bookwormpi/ClientSideTesting/actions/workflows/build.yml)

A Fabric client-side utility mod for Minecraft, focused on block search, HUD overlays, and chunk player display.

---

## Features

- **Block Search & Highlight**
  - Instantly scan loaded chunks for a specific block type.
  - See the closest found blockâ€™s icon, name, and colored coordinates in a HUD overlay.
  - All found blocks are highlighted in the world with a dynamic colored box.
  - HUD overlay is smartly positioned to avoid status effect icons.
  - Results update immediately when you change the block type or move between chunks.

- **Chunk Player HUD**
  - (Optional) Overlay showing which players are in your current chunk.

- **Performance & Usability**
  - Block search is asynchronous and throttled to avoid lag.
  - No stale or lingering results when switching block types or disabling the feature.
  - Configurable search distance and maximum rendered blocks.

- **Modern Fabric Mod**
  - Built for recent Minecraft versions using Fabric API.
  - Designed for client-side use only (no server required).
