# Multiplayer Block Search Fix Candidates

## 1. Enhanced Synchronization Fix
**Problem**: Race conditions in async scanning
**Solution**: Better synchronization and forced wait for scan completion

## 2. Chunk Loading Wait Fix  
**Problem**: Multiplayer chunk loading is slower/different
**Solution**: Add delay and retry mechanism for chunk loading

## 3. Server Sync Fix
**Problem**: Client-server chunk desync
**Solution**: Force chunk refresh before scanning

## 4. Scan State Reset Fix
**Problem**: Scanning flag gets stuck in multiplayer
**Solution**: Add timeout and force reset mechanism

## Test Plan:
1. Run debug version
2. Compare single player vs multiplayer logs
3. Identify specific failure pattern
4. Apply targeted fix
5. Verify fix works

## Debug Output to Watch For:
- "Scan already in progress, skipping request" (indicates race condition)
- Low "chunks loaded" vs "chunks scanned" ratio (indicates chunk loading issue)
- Scan completion but no results update (indicates result delivery issue)
